# codefirst-girls-group.github.io

This project was created as part of the Code First: Girls web development course (April 2019).

As a final project, we had to create a website from scratch in teams of 3. 
Given that the 3 of us come from different countries, we decided to create a travel website !
We used HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. The website is responsive and can be used on a mobile, as well as other devices.
